  ## Contributing 
  
  I want to use this space to thank my instructors and the Ask BCS Assistants for their unwaivering help when I needed it to complete this assignment.  I learned a great deal through trial and error and Google Fu.  Unfortunately, the Update Employee Role feature is not executable at this time, as I did not do the best at managing my time.  I will, however, update it and have it working in the near future.
I hope you enjoy exploring this app.

  ## Tests 
  
  no testing available.
